PRODUCT TYPES UPDATED FOR THIS ARCHIVE: APXS EDR


All APXS EDR products from Sols 0 through 179 have been revised and 
re-released. Revisions were made to their labels to correct errors 
discovered in the keyword, STOP_TIME. STOP_TIME was being set by the 
EARTH_RECEIVED_TIME value which is incorrect. A code change was made, to use 
SCLK instead, which resolved this issue.


RELEASE NUMBER: 2
RELEASE DATE: 2013-06-10
DATA COVERAGE: 2012-08-06 to 2013-02-03 (Sols 0-179)
PRODUCT TYPES RELEASED FOR THIS ARCHIVE: APXS EDR
PRODUCT TYPES UPDATED FOR THIS ARCHIVE: APXS EDR

All APXS EDR products from Sols 0 through 89 have been revised and 
re-released. Revisions were made to their labels to correct errors 
discovered in the data processing. Revised products may be identified by the 
label keyword PRODUCT_VERSION_ID, which will have a value greater than 1.0, 
and by the keyword PRODUCT_CREATION_TIME, which will have a value later than 
the previous release date of February 6, 2013.

Note: the APXS EDR data set is classified by PDS as "IN LIEN RESOLUTION"
because there are still minor liens on this data set resulting from the 
peer review. The team is working to resolve the liens.


OPGS Processing Issue Description:
----------------------------------
 
The millisecond value of the SCLK was incorrectly computed for all 
instrument EDRs since sol 0.  Specifically, only 2 digits of the millisecond 
value were being extracted from the source telemetry data product (DP) for 
the following keywords:

    MSL:LOCAL_MEAN_SOLAR_TIME        (all instruments)
    MSL:TELEMETRY_SOURCE_SCLK_START  (all instruments)
    SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT     (non-imaging instruments only)
    SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_STOP_COUNT      (APXS, MAHLI and Mastcam ML0/MR0 images)

For example, for the data product label, 
file NLA_412503611EDR_M0060000NCAM00533M1.LBL :
 
    Current values:
        MSL:LOCAL_MEAN_SOLAR_TIME         = "Sol-00169M14:40:14.027"
        MSL:TELEMETRY_SOURCE_SCLK_START   = "412503611.034"
 
    Correct values:
        MSL:LOCAL_MEAN_SOLAR_TIME         = "Sol-00169M14:40:14.271"
        MSL:TELEMETRY_SOURCE_SCLK_START   = "412503611.341"
 
This 2-digit value was then incorrectly 0 padded with a zero right after the 
decimal place. Therefore, there is always a 0 value in the tenths position 
of the Fine portion of the SCLK.  All data products affected have a 0 in the 
tenths digit for these keywords. 
 
To calculate the correct 3-digit milliseconds value, the following 
calculations can be performed.

For MSL:LOCAL_MEAN_SOLAR_TIME the correct value is 
(idph.sclk_subseconds/ 2**16) then concatenated to 5 digits.
 
For SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT(for imaging DPs) the correct value is 
(idph.sclk_subseconds/2**12) * 0.000954 then converted to integer(nothing 
after decimal point) and finally concatenated to 3 digits.

This issue will be corrected for Release 3.

The following documents in this archive are awaiting clearance by JPL 
Document Review and/or the JPL Import/Export Control Office and will be
posted online as soon as clearance has been received.

APXS_EDR_SIS.* - The MSL APXS EDR Software Interface Specification

Calibration data will be available in the APXS RDR archive, to be released
March 20, 2013.

APXS EDR data files have a four-byte checksum field at the end of the file 
that is not described by the PDS label. This will be added to the labels for
MSL Release 2, May 30, 2013.

Labels for APXS EDR data products in this release erroneously list the value 
UNK (unknown) for these keywords:
OBSERVATION_ID
COORDINATE_SYSTEM_INDEX
ORIGIN_OFFSET_VECTOR
ORIGIN_ROTATION_QUATERNION
REFERENCE_COORD_SYSTEM_INDEX
ARTICULATION_DEVICE_ANGLE
The labels will be revised to show the correct values for these keywords 
in Release 2.


******** SECTION B ********

This section is provided for general notes concerning the archive as a whole.

1. Some documents in this archive appear in Portable Document Format (PDF) 
   files. PDF files can be read using free software available at 
   www.adobe.com. PDS requires that a PDF document be accompanied by an ASCII
   text version; however, this has not been done for some PDF files in this 
   archive because the documents contain figures, tables, equations, or 
   other content that cannot be rendered as ASCII text. HTML is sometimes 
   used as an alternative to plain ASCII, but in this case suitable HTML 
   versions that captured all the content of the PDF could not be created.

2. The CONTACT_SENSOR_STATE keyword is hardcoded to "OPEN" for all product 
   labels in the archive. Correct values for the contact sensors are 
   incorporated in the binary data files and can be determined using the 
   APXS_EDR_CWA_HEADER.FMT or APXS_EDR_SCI_HEADER.FMT files. 

3. Release 11 redelivers all previous data from Releases 1-10. A correction 
   was made to fix an issue in the PDS labels where the start time had a 
   later value than the stop time.
