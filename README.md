## Welcome to GitHub Pages

The MarsRover project is essentially an educational tool to help software developers try out new algorithms and technologies in a fun and safe environment. The project has 3 essential parts viz. 1) The Rover, 2) Mission Control and 3) Command Center

1) The Rover is a softbot that you launch to the Mars surface and that you hope to control.
2) Mission Control displays the messages received from the rover, such as any findings or status reports or diagnostic heartbeats.
3) Command Center composes and forms properly formatted messages for the rover to act upon.

Part 1 is this repository, parts 2 and 3 are in a separate repository to help facilitate independent development.


### Rover

The rover is a softbot or a software robot with predefined capabilities. It is operates on the Mars surface through a series of well defined states. These states are as follows:
1) Listening State
2) Hibernating State
3) Moving State
4) Recharging State
5) Photographing State
6) Sensing State
7) Transmitting State

Following is the rover equipment list:
1) Battery/ PowerUnit.
2) Propulsion Unit*
3) Radio with transmitter and receiver*
4) Camera*
5) Lidar*
6) Spectrometer*

* indicates that the equipment is supported with its own animationEngine.
