## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mo3pheus/MarsRover/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

The MarsRover project is essentially an educational tool to help software developers try out new algorithms and technologies in a fun and safe environment. The project has 3 essential parts viz. 1) The Rover, 2) Mission Control and 3) Command Center

1) The Rover is a softbot that you launch to the Mars surface and that you hope to control.
2) Mission Control displays the messages received from the rover, such as any findings or status reports or diagnostic heartbeats.
3) Command Center composes and forms properly formatted messages for the rover to act upon.

Part 1 is this repository, parts 2 and 3 are in a separate repository to help facilitate independent development.
